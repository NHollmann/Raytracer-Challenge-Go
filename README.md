# Raytracer Challenge (Go)

This is my Go implementation of "The Ray Tracer Challenge - A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer" 
by Jamis Buck, published in 2019 by "The Pragmatic Bookshelf".

At the moment it mostly resembles the given tests and pseudocode from the book until chapter 11, reflection.
There are some modifications, mostly just for fun or to make it work with Go.
